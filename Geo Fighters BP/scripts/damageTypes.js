// Gonna type some boring notes here as its the smallest document

// Near the end of the project. can see feature creep coming
// For polishing sakes we've got a new map, lots of bug fixes
// A border system, assists, a save + load system, a build button and just a ton of fixes

// These are things that weren't planned but making it to full initial release
// Tbh they do fix massive issues we have

// The border system stops people from being able to use facing teleport under the grass out of the map and hackers (for the most part)
// Also helps stop using a waypoint in spawn and teleporting back (a separate fix stops that as well)

// The assists, not planned and dont fix anything, just helps kill stealing \_-_-_/

// A save and load system. Wasn't as such an issue until i realised dynamic properties dont save to the world but to the behaviour pack
// So the start of using scoreboards were kinda better
// However the switch to dynamic properties allows for better holding of data and other essential things this project would be lacking without

// The build button and fixes are just things to make it easier for raidz and anyone wanting to mess around in creative mode LOL

// Alot of random notes but it is what it is
// If I ever upload the source code to git hub that is gonna be such a bore for readers

// If I don't I've just been talking to myself alot...



// Still writing more notes here because why not.

// Time to write some lore
// Hobo joe, the one, big man.
// He had a whole village, a city, a farm.
// He owned multiple businesses that travelled all the resources overseas and over train
// Hobo joe yearned for power. His strive for more was detremonical. He wanted to rule the world. (Like elon musk)
// He was the putin of the geo world. He went exploring, hiring every scientist he knew. The best ones he could find. The strongest, best and craziest minds of the world
// But alas to no success. So. he gave up. He still wanted more. He wanted to leave. Space was the next option... So he went. Flying away off to mars.
// Where he would find something extremely potential. Fake lore. Hobo joe isnt real. Made you read this for no reason lol.
// He held data inside the crazy chaotic database which he used to get research for his new found geo dust :sparkle:
